                    <p>This project contains the Compukids websites developed during Week 1 of the FNB App Academy 2025, covering the fundamentals of HTML and how websites are structured.
                         The main index.html page links to multiple individual pages including boat.html, city.html, plane.html, plane2.html, yacht.html, lists.html, cablecar.html, links.html, and about.html. 
                         Each page demonstrates core HTML concepts such as hyperlinks, images, lists, and semantic elements, providing a practical introduction to building simple, interconnected web pages.</p>
